- The actual Next app lives in 'losers_only' directory, so you need to cd into that directory to work within the app
- run `npm export` when in the app to build the app. This will be built out in the 'out' file. You need to transfer that file into the root directory's 'docs' directory. This is where the built site will be referenced via GH.
- in order to run git commands, you need to be in root directory
